# A Complete Guide to Data Wrangling using Pandas
![Pandas Logo](./images/pandas_logo.png)
Pandas is one of the core components of the Data Science toolkit. It is effective in loading, analyzing and manipulating relational/labeled data.

### Installing Pandas
For Python users:
```
pip install pandas
```

For Anaconda users, Pandas comes pre-installed, if not
```
conda install pandas
```
In this IPython Notebook, I will demonstrate how to Load, Explore, and Manipulate Data using Pandas. I have utilized the 'mpg' data set that comes with the seaborn package.

### [Dataset](./data/mpg_dataset.csv) - mpg dataset used for demonstration

## [Article - Essential Data Wrangling Skills for Data Scientists in 2021]() - Published on Towards Data Science

I recommend you refer to the Article for conceptual understanding and parallelly try executing the commands from the IPython Notebook.
